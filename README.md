# Requirement Analysis: Defining Features and Functionalities

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

---

## 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clarity and Understanding**: Reduces ambiguity by clarifying stakeholder expectations.  
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines the scope, helping prevent scope creep.  
- **Basis for Design and Development**: Provides a solid foundation for system design.  
- **Cost and Time Estimation**: Facilitates accurate estimation of resources, time, and cost.  
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the final product meets specified requirements, increasing customer satisfaction.

## 🔑 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️
- **Interviews**: Collect detailed info directly from stakeholders.  
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Broader input from a large audience.  
- **Workshops**: Collaborative discussions for requirement discovery.  
- **Observation**: Analyze user environment and behaviors.  
- **Document Analysis**: Study existing documentation and systems.  

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️
- **Brainstorming**: Generate and refine ideas.  
- **Focus Groups**: Gather insights from selected stakeholder groups.  
- **Prototyping**: Visualize and refine requirements via prototypes.  

### 3. Requirement Documentation 📚
- **Requirement Specification Document (SRS)**: Comprehensive requirements list.  
- **User Stories**: Functionalities described from the user perspective.  
- **Use Cases**: Diagrams showing system–user interactions.  

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 📊
- **Requirement Prioritization**: Order requirements by importance/impact.  
- **Feasibility Analysis**: Assess technical, financial, and time viability.  
- **Modeling**: Create DFDs, ERDs, or flow diagrams to visualize requirements.  

### 5. Requirement Validation ✅
- **Review and Approval**: Confirm requirements with stakeholders.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define measurable success conditions.  
- **Traceability**: Use traceability matrices to link requirements to development and testing.

## 🛠️ Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements ⚙️
> Define **what** the system should do.

**Examples:**
- User authentication  
- Property search  
- Booking system  
- User registration  

**Key Functional Requirements:**
- **Search Properties**: Filter by location, price, availability.  
- **User Registration**: Create accounts with personal details.  
- **Property Listings**: Show images, prices, and property info.  
- **Booking System**: Book, manage, and view booking details.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/registration.  

### Non-functional Requirements 🛡️
> Define **how** the system should perform.

**Key Non-functional Requirements:**
- **Performance**: Pages load within 2 seconds; supports 1000 concurrent users.  
- **Security**: Data encryption, secure login, vulnerability protection.  
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for high traffic.  
- **Usability**: Intuitive UI/UX.  
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, fast recovery from failures.

## 📊 Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
Visual representations of interactions between **actors (users)** and the **system**.

### Steps to Create:
1. Identify actors (e.g., guest, registered user, admin).  
2. Define use cases (e.g., search properties, book property, manage listings).  
3. Draw interactions between actors and use cases.  

**Benefits:**
- Clear visual representation of system functionality.  
- Organizes and structures requirements.  
- Improves stakeholder–developer communication.  

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### What is Acceptance Criteria?
Conditions that a feature must meet before being accepted.  

### How to Define:
- Be **specific and measurable**.  
- Cover **functional and non-functional** aspects.  

**Example – Booking System:**  
“Users should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.”  

**Benefits:**
- Ensures alignment among stakeholders.  
- Provides basis for testing and validation.  
- Helps maintain software quality.
