Requirement Analysis: Defining Features and Functionalities
🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product.
It ensures that all stakeholders share a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

⚡ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Clarity & Understanding: Eliminates ambiguity by capturing stakeholder expectations.

Scope Definition: Prevents scope creep by clearly outlining boundaries.

Foundation for Design & Development: Provides a reliable base for system architecture.

Accurate Estimations: Improves cost, resource, and timeline planning.

Quality Assurance: Ensures the end product aligns with requirements → higher customer satisfaction.

🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️

Interviews: One-on-one sessions with stakeholders.

Surveys/Questionnaires: Collecting large-scale feedback.

Workshops: Collaborative discussions for requirement alignment.

Observation: Studying end-users in their environment.

Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation & legacy systems.

2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️

Brainstorming: Generating diverse ideas.

Focus Groups: In-depth discussions with targeted stakeholders.

Prototyping: Building mockups to refine requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation 📚

Requirement Specification Document (SRS).

User Stories: Functional descriptions from a user’s perspective.

Use Cases: Diagrams showing system-user interactions.

4. Requirement Analysis & Modeling 📊

Prioritization: Ranking requirements by business value.

Feasibility Analysis: Evaluating technical, financial, and time feasibility.

Modeling: Creating DFDs, ER diagrams, and process models.

5. Requirement Validation ✅

Review & Approval: Confirming accuracy with stakeholders.

Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear measurable outcomes.

Traceability: Ensuring all requirements map to development and testing.

🔧 Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements ⚙️

➡️ Define what the system should do.
Examples:

Search properties

User registration

Booking system

Authentication & authorization

Key Functional Features:

Search Properties: Filter by location, price, and availability.

User Registration: Create accounts with secure credentials.

Property Listings: Show images, descriptions, and amenities.

Booking System: Book, manage, and view reservations.

User Authentication: Ensure secure login/registration.

Non-Functional Requirements 🛡️

➡️ Define how the system should perform.
Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

Key Non-Functional Needs:

Performance: Load pages in ≤ 2s; support 1000+ concurrent users.

Security: Encryption, secure login, protection from vulnerabilities.

Scalability: Handle growing traffic via horizontal scaling.

Usability: Simple, intuitive UI/UX.

Reliability: 99.9% uptime with fast recovery from failures.

📑 Requirement Analysis Process

Gathering: Collect requirements from stakeholders.

Elicitation: Refine and expand requirements.

Documentation: Create structured requirement artifacts.

Analysis & Modeling: Prioritize and model requirements.

Validation: Review with stakeholders + define acceptance criteria.

📊 Use Case Diagrams

Objective: Show interactions between users (actors) and the system (use cases).

Actors: Guest, Registered User, Admin.

Use Cases: Search properties, book property, manage listings.

Benefits:
✔️ Easy visualization of system functionalities
✔️ Aligns stakeholders & developers
✔️ Helps organize requirements

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Definition: Measurable conditions a feature must meet for stakeholder approval.

How to Define:

Be specific, measurable, and testable.

Cover functional + non-functional aspects.

Example (Booking System):
“Users should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.”

Benefits:

Sets clear expectations

Provides a testing benchmark

Improves quality alignment
