# 📋 Requirement Analysis: Defining Features and Functionalities  

---

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?  
Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines requirements. It ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of **what the system should do** and **how it should perform**.

## 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 Clarity | Defines stakeholder expectations and reduces ambiguity |
| 📐 Scope Definition | Prevents scope creep by setting clear project boundaries |
| 🏗️ Foundation | Serves as the basis for design & development |
| ⏱️ Estimation | Enables accurate cost, time, and resource planning |
| ✅ Quality | Ensures final product meets expectations and increases satisfaction |

## 🔑 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

### 1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️  
- **Interviews** with stakeholders  
- **Surveys & Questionnaires** for larger audience input  
- **Workshops** to collaboratively discuss requirements  
- **Observation** of user environment and workflows  
- **Document Analysis** of existing systems  

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️  
- **Brainstorming** sessions  
- **Focus Groups** for deeper insights  
- **Prototyping** for early visualization  

### 3. Requirement Documentation 📚  
- **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**  
- **User Stories** written from the user perspective  
- **Use Cases** and **Diagrams**  

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 📊  
- **Prioritization** of requirements by value/impact  
- **Feasibility Analysis** (technical, financial, time)  
- **Modeling** (DFDs, ERDs, Flowcharts)  

### 5. Requirement Validation ✅  
- **Review & Approval** with stakeholders  
- **Acceptance Criteria** definition  
- **Traceability Matrix** to ensure coverage

## 🛠️ Types of Requirements  

### Functional Requirements ⚙️  
> Describe **what the system should do**  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔍 Search Properties | Filter by location, price, availability |
| 📝 User Registration | Create accounts with personal details |
| 🏠 Property Listings | Show images, descriptions, prices |
| 📅 Booking System | Book, cancel, and view reservations |
| 🔑 Authentication | Secure login & registration |

### Non-Functional Requirements 🛡️  
> Define **how the system should perform**  

| Attribute | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| ⚡ Performance | Pages load < 2s; handle 1000 concurrent users |
| 🔒 Security | Data encryption, secure login, prevent attacks |
| 📈 Scalability | Support horizontal scaling |
| 🎨 Usability | Intuitive UI/UX with accessibility |
| 🔄 Reliability | 99.9% uptime, quick recovery from failures |
