# 📋 Requirement Analysis: Defining Features and Functionalities  
---

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?  
Requirement Analysis is a **critical phase** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the requirements for a software product.  

The purpose is to ensure **all stakeholders (users, developers, testers, and business owners)** share the same understanding of **what the system should do** and **how it should perform**.

## 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 Clarity | Reduces ambiguity by making requirements explicit |
| 📐 Scope Control | Prevents **scope creep** through well-defined boundaries |
| 🏗️ Solid Foundation | Serves as blueprint for design & development |
| ⏱️ Estimation | Enables accurate estimation of **time, resources, and costs** |
| ✅ Quality Assurance | Ensures final product aligns with business needs |

## 🔑 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis  

### 1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️  
Techniques used:  
- **Interviews** → One-on-one with stakeholders  
- **Surveys** → Collect input from a wide audience  
- **Workshops** → Collaborative sessions with users  
- **Observation** → Studying real user workflows  
- **Document Analysis** → Reviewing existing systems/policies  

---

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️  
- **Brainstorming sessions** to capture ideas  
- **Focus groups** for deeper insights  
- **Prototyping** (wireframes/mockups) to visualize features  

---

### 3. Requirement Documentation 📚  
Artifacts created:  
- **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**  
- **User Stories** (As a user, I want X so that Y)  
- **Use Cases** (formal scenarios & diagrams)  

---

### 4. Requirement Analysis & Modeling 📊  
- **Prioritization** (MoSCoW: Must, Should, Could, Won’t)  
- **Feasibility checks** (technical, financial, time)  
- **Models** → DFDs, ERDs, Flowcharts  

---

### 5. Requirement Validation ✅  
- **Review & Approval** from stakeholders  
- **Acceptance Criteria** for measurable success  
- **Traceability Matrix** linking requirements to design & tests

## 🛠️ Types of Requirements  

### Functional Requirements ⚙️  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Search Properties** | Filter listings by location, price, date, amenities |
| 📝 **User Registration** | Create accounts with personal details & login credentials |
| 🏠 **Property Listings** | Show property images, details, availability |
| 📅 **Booking System** | Reserve, view, cancel bookings |
| 🔑 **Authentication** | Secure login/registration |
| ⭐ **Reviews** | Users can add and view property reviews |
| 📩 **Notifications** | Email/SMS confirmations for bookings |

### Non-Functional Requirements 🛡️  

| Attribute | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| ⚡ **Performance** | Pages load < 2s; system supports 1000 concurrent users |
| 🔒 **Security** | End-to-end encryption, prevent SQLi, XSS |
| 📈 **Scalability** | Horizontal scaling for traffic spikes |
| 🎨 **Usability** | WCAG-compliant UI/UX |
| 🔄 **Reliability** | 99.9% uptime with auto-recovery |
| 🌍 **Localization** | Support multiple currencies & languages |
